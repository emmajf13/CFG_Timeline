<h5>Origin
On the 6th of June 2012, YouTuber Laina Morris uploaded a webcam video of her performing a parody of Justin Beiber’s single “Boyfriend” with personalized lyrics. The parody, with its clingy and stalker-like lyrics became viral and in less than 48 hours after its upload had received more than 1.35 million views. The next day on the 7th of June, Redditor yeahhtoast submitted a link to the video in a Reddit thread titled “Overly Attached Girlfriend” and within a few hours an advice animal character had been created with the same name. </h5>
